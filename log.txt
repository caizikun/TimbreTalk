Log for Timbre Talk
 This log is kept with the source code and is refined as the source code changes
 providing a human readable summary of the past, present and future of the code
 base. As issues are encountered, they are entered under the Issues: section. As
 they are resolved or things are changed, they are entered under the Updates:
 section. Once they are no longer relavent, they are removed. The repository will
 contain tags or major milestones which delineate these removals so as to serve
 as a signpost in the source code development preventing the accumulation of clutter.

 	 ecPacketHandler

    and or printed to launch window. no error should happen without notifying anyone
