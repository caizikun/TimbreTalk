Log for Timbre Talk

Issues:
 1. when clicking on send and transfer happens error produced:
 	 ecPacketHandler
     error: structure bigger than list: str=14 list=11
 2. Utility Tab should have list of printme's that can be turned while running
 3. errors should be caught throughout and put into a log either on a tab or a file
    and or printed to launch window. no error should happen without notifying anyone
 4. when the serial port is bombed, the gui should still function. there should be a
    throttle back option to keep sane
 5. shift base over to pyside to resolve any license issues
 6. generalize code base for Timbre Talk and accept plug ins for:
     protocol, pids, cpuids, targets
 7. make it look prettier on Linux, Windows
 8. make it easy to release a binary for windows and mac
 9. add collaborative max length negotiations for sfp protocol
 10. revise, update and test all code
 11. file button stays blue after loading file
